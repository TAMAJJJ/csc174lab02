        Makoto Shinkai (新海 誠, Shinkai Makoto, born Makoto Niitsu (新津 誠,
        Niitsu Makoto); February 9, 1973) is a Japanese animator, filmmaker, and
        manga artist best known for directing Your Name, the highest-grossing
        anime film of all time at the time of release,and was listed by Variety
        as one of 10 animators to watch in 2016.
      </p>

      <p>
        A native of Nagano Prefecture, Shinkai studied Japanese literature at
        Chuo University, where he was a member of the juvenile literature club
        and drew picture books. He traces his passion for creation to the manga,
        anime and novels he was exposed to in middle school. His favorite anime
        films are Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Nausicaä and The Castle of
        Cagliostro by Hayao Miyazaki, The End of Evangelion by Hideaki Anno and
        Patlabor 2 by Mamoru Oshii.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shinkai has been called "The New Miyazaki" in several reviews, including
        those by Anime Advocates and ActiveAnime—comparisons he calls an
        "overestimation".He is married to retired actress and producer Chieko
        Misaka, star of films including Versus by Ryuhei Kitamura; they have a
        daughter, child actress Chise Niitsu (born 2010). Asteroid 55222
        Makotoshinkai is named after him.
      </p>
      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>
        After graduating from Chuo University in 1994, he got a job at Falcom, a
        video game company where he worked for 5 years making video clips for
        games and graphic design including web content. During this time he met
        musician Tenmon, who later scored many of his movies.In 1999, Shinkai
        released She and Her Cat, a five-minute short piece done in monochrome.
        It won several awards, including the grand prize at the 12th DoGA CG
        Animation contest (2000). DoGA is an independent nonprofit company set
        up to encourage entry-level animators with software and advice. The
        short details the life of a cat, entirely from the cat's perspective, as
        it passes time with its owner, a young woman.
      </p>

      <p>
        After winning the grand prize, Shinkai began thinking about a follow-up
        while he continued working for Falcom. In June 2000, Shinkai was
        inspired to begin Voices of a Distant Star by drawing a picture of a
        girl in a cockpit grasping a cell phone. Some time later, he was
        contacted by Manga Zoo (today a smartphone app), which offered to work
        with him, giving him a grant to turn his idea into an anime they could
        sell. In May 2001, he quit his job at Falcom and began to work on
        Voices. In an interview, Shinkai noted that production took around seven
        months of "real work".
      </p>

      <p>
        Voices of a Distant Star was followed by the 90-minute The Place
        Promised in Our Early Days, which was released nationwide in Japan on
        November 20, 2004. It was critically acclaimed, winning many honors.
        Shinkai's next project was 5 Centimeters per Second and premiered 3
        March 2007. It consists of three short films: Cherry Blossom, Cosmonaut,
        and 5 Centimeters per Second.[15] The total run time is about 63
        minutes. In September 2007 Nagano's leading newspaper, Shinano Mainichi
        Shinbun, released a TV commercial animated by Shinkai.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shinkai spent 2008 in London, resting since the completion of 5
        Centimeters per Second. He returned to Japan in 2009 to start work on
        his next project. He released two concept drawings for this film in
        December 2009. Shinkai noted that it would be his longest animation film
        to date and described the story as a "lively" animated film with
        adventure, action, and romance centered on a cheerful and spirited girl
        on a journey to say "farewell".[16] In November 2010, he revealed that
        his next work would be titled Children Who Chase Lost Voices from Deep
        Below. A teaser trailer was released on November 9, and the film was
        released on May 7, 2011.
      </p>

      <p>
        His next feature, The Garden of Words, was released on May 31, 2013.On
        August 26, 2016, Shinkai released Your Name. The film received positive
        reviews, giving praise for its narrative, animation, music, and
        emotional weight, and was also a commercial success, becoming the
        fourth-highest-grossing film of all time in Japan and, as of January 16,
        2017, the highest-grossing anime film of all time, overtaking Miyazaki's
        Spirited Away. Shinkai's next project Weathering with You was released
        on July 19, 2019 in Japan.

      <h2>Personal Quotes</h2>
      <p>
        The thing about getting rejected is that you reflect and think and
        analyze about why you got turned down. You learn a lot more from stories
        about getting rejected than stories about becoming happy. That's why I
        prefer those stories. If I must say something about Mari Okada...I love
        Toradora! (2008), which she wrote the screenplay for, a lot. And I think
        that The Garden of Words (2013) is influenced by the way the characters
        express their emotions in Toradora. I really do think that.
      </p>

      <p>
        In most of the world today people are interested in communication. They
        don't watch TV or play games that much; communication is becoming more
        of AN Entertainment form in itself. So when the society in which I live
        has this tendency that communication is so important, it has naturally
        become a central point of interest for my works.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first thing you make is a story. Then you decide where the location
        of the story will be, and how the story will develop. And then, when you
        think how the visuals will be in this process, then you finally think
        about how you take something from the setting and use it, how to depict
        it, and how to make the setting beautiful. That's when you begin to
        think that. So the story always comes first. I am offered the chance
        sometimes to work with an anime series, and it is something I feel I
        should try and be a part of, but at the moment I do not feel like I am
        ready for it yet and that I have not done enough work. But I am really
        interested in doing an anime series one day. Ever since I was a child I
        always had cats with me. I'm from the Nagano prefecture, and while
        living there I had cats, and after I came to Tokyo I also picked up some
        strays and started raising them. So I definitely always had cats with
        me.
